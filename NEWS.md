## Unreleased changes
- PSL `next_e` and `next_e!` operators are now supported.

  printed to `stderr`, including those at `failure` severity (#1357).
- The VITAL and Synopsys packages are now compiled into the `ieee`
  library for VHDL-2019 (#1360).
- The new `--relative=DIR` analysis option saves all file names relative
  to `DIR`.  This can be useful to ensure reproducibility of binary
  libraries (#1359).
- Very large subprograms containing tens of thousands of operations can
  now be compiled (#1259).
- Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1237, #1350, #1351, #1353,
  #1366).

- Fixed a mis-optimisation which would cause the result of `x * x` to be
  zero (#1338, from @Blebowski).
- Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1239, #1332, #1334, #1335,
  #1347, #1348).

## Version 1.18.1 - 2025-10-18
- Fixed a crash when compiling with AVX2 enabled (#1311).
- Calling `vhpi_get(vhpiBaseType, ..)` on a subtype with additional
  constraints such as `natural range 0 to 1` now correctly returns the
  `vhpiIntTypeDeclK` base type instead of another `vhpiSubtypeDeclK`.
- Fixed a crash when `release` is used with a record signal (#1313).
- Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1308, #1317, #1318, #1323).

- Scheduling of blocking and non-blocking assignments in mixed-language
  simulation now more accurately reflects Verilog semantics (#1227).
- Aliases of component declarations are now allowed (#1276).
- Added missing check that partial associations appear in a contiguous
  sequence (#1254).
- The new `-I` analysis option adds search directories for the Verilog
  `include` directive.

- Fixed a crash when `--cover-file` is specified with a non-existent
  directory (#1287).
- The `-f` analysis option can now interpolate environment variables in
  the file list using `$var`.
- Constraints for variables and signals declared with partially
  constrained subtypes are now correctly propagated from the initial
  value (#1274).
- VHDL-2002 changes for buffer port connections are now implemented
  correctly (#1290).

  calling convention now works correctly (#1301).
- Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1253, #1269, #1277, #1279,
  #1280, #1281).

## Version 1.17.2 - 2025-08-22

  mode view would have the wrong direction when the port was partially
  associated.
- Package instantiation declarations are now allowed in the entity
  declarative part (#1266).
- Fixed a crash when `'subtype` is applied to an array object with
  static bounds declared in another design unit (#1271).
- Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1257, #1260, #1262, #1264,
  #1267, #1270, #1272, #1273).

## Version 1.17.1 - 2025-07-26
- Fixed a build failure on Linux Arm64 (#1246).
- An `others` choice is now allowed in an unconstrained array aggregate
  if the `--relaxed` option is passed and the aggregate appears in one
  of the contexts where the VHDL-2019 "function knows vector size"
  feature applies (#641, #1175).
- VHPI handles have been made more robust.  A user-visible effect of
  this change is that handles with distinct pointer values may refer to
  the same object.  Always use `vhpi_compare_handles` to compare handles
  rather than comparing the value of the handles directly.
- Type marks like `arr(index)'subtype` are now parsed correctly (#1245).
- Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1249).

## Version 1.17.0 - 2025-07-12

- Added `--merge-mode` option to control behaviour when merging
  non-equal coverage databases.
- `generate` statements now create separate hierarchy in the code
  coverage report
- Fixed "unit is too big to compile" error with very large number of
  signals (#1200).
- Just-in-time compilation is now the default and the `--jit`
  elaboration option has no effect.  Use `--precompile` to restore the
  previous behaviour.
- Fixed a crash when `set_cover_scope_name` from `nvc.cover_pkg` was
  called with coverage disabled (#1218).

  warnings only in the first time step (from @supleed2).
- Top-level generics can now be set to hexadecimal values from the
  command line using `-g name='X"12"'`.  The value must be escaped or
  quoted to avoid the double quotes being interpreted by the shell.
- Fixed a crash when ports with view mode indications are partially
  associated in a port map (#1208).
- Files declared in impure functions are now closed after the `return`
  expression has been evaluated rather than before (#1229).

- Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1220, #1233, #1234, #1239).

## Version 1.16.2 - 2025-06-11
- Fixed a crash when an entity uses VHDL-2019 enhanced type generics and

  individually (#1201).

  VHPI (#1213).

  than 2**32 elements (#1196).

- Added support for PSL `prev()`, `stable()`, `rose()` and `fell()`
  built-in functions (#1135).
- Signals can now be read and passed to subprograms during elaboration
  and the effective value is the default value associated with the
  signal.  This behaviour is not defined by the LRM but matches all
  other simulators (#1144).
- MSYS2 binary packages are no longer provided with releases as these
  become out-of-date too quickly.  Windows users should instead download
  the self-contained MSI package.
- The Ubuntu binary packages for releases now have predictable names
  without the git commit hash (#1131).
- Improved error messages when design units have circular dependencies
  or depend on obsolete design units (#1152).

- Added an experimental `--preserve-case` analysis option to retain the
  original spelling of VHDL identifiers (#723).
- `--ieee-warnings` is now a global option and should be placed before
  the `-r` command.  Passing it to the `-r` command is still supported
  but deprecated and may not take effect in some situations (#1151).
- Fixed a crash when a partial association in a port map has a
  conversion function (#1161).
- Improved the formatting of the `--help` output.

- Unconstrained input ports can now be constrained by the result subtype
  of a conversion function (#1171).
- Type marks are now allowed in the prefix of selected names in relaxed
  mode (#1173).
- Added the `nvc.random` random number generation package and `--seed`
  argument for deterministic results.

  bugs (#1178).

  #1188).

## Version 1.15.2 - 2025-03-01

- Fixed a bug where PSL directives in comments were parsed incorrectly
  when split over multiple lines (#1135).

## Version 1.15.0 - 2025-01-11
- `--load` is now a global option and should be placed before the `-r`
  command.  This allows VHPI foreign subprograms to be called during
  elaboration (#988).

  (#1025).
- Added a functional coverage API in `nvc.cover_pkg` that can be used by
  external frameworks such as OSVVM to define cover points.

  `vhpi_register_cb` (#1045).
- Removed the limit on the maximum number of parameters that can be
  passed to a VHDL subprogram (#1036).
- The new `--no-save` analysis option parses and checks the input files
  but does not save the working library to disk.  This is a replacement
  for the `--syntax` top-level command which is now deprecated.
- The coverage database file name has changed to `<toplevel>.ncdb` in
  the current working directory and this can now be customised with the
  new `--cover-file=` elaboration option.  Attempts to access the old
  file name inside the library directory will be redirected to the new
  location, with a warning.
- Partial association of ports with interface views now works correctly
  (#1074).

  of determining the simulation exit code and early termination (#1060).

  attributes of generate block labels (from @NikLeberg) (#1125).

  on Apple silicon macOS (#1069).

  multiple times (#1079).

  association range choice which associates an array slice (#1080).
- Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1038, #1055).

## Version 1.14.1 - 2024-10-26

  than crashing at runtime (#965).

  a record (#662).
